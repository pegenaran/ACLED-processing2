The development came a day after the president's appointment of Robredo was officially announced in Manila, following days of heated exchanges between their two camps, where the president dared the vice president to do better than the administration in the implementation of the drug war. In their preceding tit-for-tat, Duterte had said he would give the 'drug czar' position to Robredo for a couple of months, in which time she would have 'full powers' over the drug war. Robredo's allies in the opposition cautioned her against taking the post, saying she was being set up for failure and that she would be made a scapegoat, but she ultimately took the post, saying she would use the opportunity to put an end to the 'senseless' drug war killings.
