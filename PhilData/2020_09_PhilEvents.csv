The US marine, who has been held in a local facility since 2014 and was meant to serve a 10-year sentence for homicide, was in the country as part of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Philippines and the United States. The court order has been criticised by several groups including the Office of the President, and it has reignited debate on the VFA, which President Duterte originally wanted to abrogate earlier this year, but the abrogation was postponed due to the pandemic. On 7 September, President Duterte granted the US marine an absolute pardon amid widespread criticism, rendering moot legal challenges to the early release and triggering several protests over the issue. On 13 September, the US marine was flown out of the Philippines."
