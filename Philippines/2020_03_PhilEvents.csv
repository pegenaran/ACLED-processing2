The signed bill - a watered down version of what was originally proposed by the government prior to lengthy Congressional and Senate debates - gave the president the authority to disburse emergency monetary assistance to families hardest-hit by the pandemic as well as health workers, to reallocate government savings, and to temporarily take over the operation of private medical facilities and transportation.

The CPP said that the ceasefire declaration was a direct response to United Nations Secretary General's call for a global ceasefire between warring parties amid the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic, and that it is meant to allow unhampered medical and economic assistance efforts. The CPP had earlier refused to reciprocate the government's own unilateral ceasefire declaration, already in effect from 19 March to 15 April 2020. On 15 April 2020, the CPP extended the ceasefire to 30 April 2020."
